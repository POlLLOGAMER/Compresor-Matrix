# Compresor-Matrix
The Compresor Matrix (CM), is a compression technique that in itself all the text information to be compressed, converts it into a matrix table, and then inserts the values ​​of the matrix tables into pixels of an image on a color scale, each intensity corresponds to an acci value, now to decompress it checks pixel by pixel and decompresses the acci characters, this algorithm is optimized to not save spaces to optimize space.
